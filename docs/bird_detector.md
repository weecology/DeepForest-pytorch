# Bird Detector

Utilizing the same workflow as the tree detection model, we have trained a bird detection model for airborne imagery.

```
m = main.deepforest()
m.use_bird_release()
```

We have created a [GPU colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e9_pZM0n_v3MkZpSjVRjm55-LuCE2IYE?usp=sharing
) to demonstrate the workflow for using the bird model.

For more information, or specific questions about the bird detection, please create issues on the [BirdDetector repo](https://github.com/weecology/BirdDetector)

The detector is currently in prep, please check back for a published citation. Cite the github release until a preprint is available.
